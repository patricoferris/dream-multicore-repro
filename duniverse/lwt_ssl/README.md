# Lwt_ssl: OpenSSL binding with concurrent I/O

An Lwt-enabled wrapper around [OCaml-SSL][ocaml-ssl], that performs I/O
concurrently. Ocaml-SSL, in turn, is a binding to the much-used
[OpenSSL][openssl].

To install, do `opam install lwt_ssl`.

For documentation, see the [`.mli` file][mli].

This package was formerly maintained in the [main Lwt repo][lwt]. Most of the
git history and changelog still refer to Lwt_ssl's days in Lwt.
