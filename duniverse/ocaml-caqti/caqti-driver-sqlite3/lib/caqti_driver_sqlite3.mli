(** Sqlite3 driver for Caqti (bindings).

    This driver is implemented in terms of the sqlite3 OPAM package, which
    provides bindings for libsqlite3.  It handles URIs of the form
    {[
      sqlite3://<path>?create=<bool>&write=<bool>
    ]}
    where [<path>] is passed to {!Sqlite3.db_open} and the query string is used
    to determine its [mode] parameter.  The [<bool>] parameters take the values
    [true] and [false], and default to [true]. *)
